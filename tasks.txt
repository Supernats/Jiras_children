  THINGS:
    ☐ differentiate new stuff,
                ☐ from the old.

 ☐ I am tasked everything

 ☐ I am tasked to fix all the things

-------------------------------------

  ## ✔ validate input:
     ☐ REQUIRES RESEARCH AND MAGIC!
     ☐ try to shove on http:// if possible @done (14-07-16 10:20)
          ☐ try to remember to upgrade to ☐ SSL ☐ version of the internet

      ☐ * Limit content to 2 plain text characters for all fields
      ☐ * Link to open asynchronous lightbox always
      ☐ * Support for "featured" social share options
        REGISTER:
          ☐ MAKE IT PASS THE HTML SPEC CUZ ITS SO STUPID TO BREAK IT

==============MEDIA-CONTENT-BUGS===========================
 ☐ DO IMAGE THING TO VIDEOS
 ☐ INVESTIGATE OTHER TERRIBLE SELECT OPTIONS
 ☐ SIDEBAR FOR TABS!!!!!
 ☐ DOWNCASE ALL  USER EMAIL (content))EVERYWHERE!


##### USERS?:
   ☐ on wireframe, add new iteration of the intake flow
   ☐ NO RESOURCE, RESOURCES ONLY!
   ☐ *HIDE POSITIONAL SORTING ON FRONT PAGE
     ☐ ADD POSITIONAL SORTING TO RESOURCE PAGES
       ☐ BUT BOTH SHOULD RETURN SAME TYPE OF OBJECT AS FAR AS VIEWS ARE CONCERNED.

 POSSIBLE BLOCKER HELL:
    ☐ from wizzywig
      ☐ MUST 'SEE' the IFRAME and execute arbitrary javascript within it.
           ☐ ☐ ☐  responsively
      ☐ && GET THE CALLBACK

IMHO best approach is to provide the absolute simplest interface from the start:
