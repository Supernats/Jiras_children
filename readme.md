"@aichinge: @ryah Isn't it just problem of your lazyness to setup your IDE?" Yes
"developerati" new buzz word
"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler" often repeated, rarely heeded.
"No one ever got fired for long-polling" lol
"production ready" is such a stupid term - people employ it as if it were some universal truth.
"yeah, let's fuckin rage"

#survey What kind of #nodejs applications are you implementing? twtpoll.com/oceh0r
#voxer is hiring. Node.JS engineers. Riak. Ops. So popular now that the servers are melting down. Props to #soldjaboy fans for the QA
(seriously - benchmarkers - at the very least say what code your testing...)
(TBH I really love ‪#dartlang‬ - optional typing is the future!)
(‪#dartlang‬ people: I complain only because I love your work and i care to see Dart become successful)

@aaronheckmann until i get a better implementation
@ahzf roll eyes
@amjad_masad sounds really hard
@antirez I for one would love to see this work merged. We want your help with libuv performance!
@applepie yes but a specific type. like this http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SplitStacks …
@avalanche123 nothing - it's just going to be up to the user to integrate with it. so it'll be a dep of node not a dep of libuv
@bascule @igrigorik does chrome do ws over spdy currently? any websites that do it? does it mask?
@bascule @ra66i - :)
@bascule without ninjas?...
@basus it makes it too hard to prototype with.
@bertuz83 i did that for many years, far more difficult than instant coffee and tbh i prefer the taste of instant
@binary42 you don't need super fast process/thread creation. very high concurrency can be had inside of one context. eg node, eventmachin
@bradfitz Definitely there are some annoyances - but generally it solves my problem well.
@chanux ryan
@charsyam last time i checked it didn't do iocp well.
@charsyam omg - no. remember that we made libuv in response to these libraries.
@chrislea We need new @nodejs packages - it seems yours are still at 0.6.2
@chrislea yeah - catch me on IRC in #node.js
@cognominal i meant the win in terms getting my desired features that aren't in existing languages
@cramforce a quick little tornado benchmark http://s3.amazonaws.com/fou...
@cramforce do you like this https://soundcloud.com/hypercrush/sombody-that-i-used-to-know … ?
@cramforce i think that one is considered electro house?
@crucially ?
@crucially I would love to make things go faster but I'm just not convinced this is the right problem to worry about. Maybe I'm wrong.
@crucially Many people use Node, I've dealt with many of their problems. This has not been a problem I've encountered - just my experience.
@crucially shrug. i just dont see how IPCing a lot faster makes web servers go faster when you've got 1000 connections on a thread.
@crucially we'll see when the future gets here :)
@davglass, send a bug report to the mailing list - hard to debug on twitter ;)
@DeirdreS hah. No no no. The sexiest thing in Node is @sh1mmer's accent.
@derbyjs looks pretty sweet
@dibblego the better way is to run dartium - a build of chromium with the dart VM embedded but I want my workflow to hit the generated JS.
@DrPizza ....
@drx just an observation
@drx yes. Vastly better. Gyp is a meta-build system so it can actually generate scons scripts. But... well its different
@dshaw @maxogden @ryah OK, fixed. http://dshaw.me/MVFSu7
@dshaw no but that track is sweet :)
@felixge @manuelkiessling @yeebase_t3n oops - ich hab das gesehen irgendwo in meinem twitter feed gestern. ich dachte es ist von nov 2011 :P
@felixge being interviewed about #nodejs http://thechangelog.com/post/501053444/episode-0-2-0-node-js-with-felix-geisendorfer
@felixge i didn't notice
@ffloat i'll wait until you get bert and ben on
@ffloat oh yes!
@fictorial http://wiki.github.com/ry/node/library-compatibility
@gchan2800 in v0.6.6 it does
@graydon2 want JavaScript with goroutines and no shared memory.
@graydon2 You should try GYP. In a certain light, one can see it as the first module system for C.
@gregferrell yes and no
@hij1nx nice :)
@indutny mmap packet buffers into userland and write your own TCP stack with http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/  then you will have control
@indutny oh yes - POSIX is fucked.
@indutny what do you mean. the entire world is built on tcp. it's remarkably good.
@iOSXyZ moving - no cause for concern :>![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)![GitHub Logo](/assets/Node.js-by-Ryan-Dahl.jpg)

@izs @mikeal That does seem to be the case. For example, I often tell people i know a lot about algebraic topology ;-)
@izs @Raynos2 sold already sorry
@izs @substack they teach you in math school to shake your hands wildly while speaking http://tinyclouds.org/20050419_page2 …
@izs so true
@jashkenas Thanks for the link. Guido is good on that.
@jbboehr @SoCalNodejs unknown to me
@jcoglan Ah, you mean it's a bandaid feature to an already difficult and questionably beneficial construct. Got it.
@jdub Originally Node used GnuTLS. We switched for licensing and availability reasons. It's definitely a better API.
@jedschmidt oh, neat :)
@jhebert jealousy
@jmathai @franksvalli not the right guy but thanks
@joemccann @cramforce dont worry, no one has - it's still unusable
@joemccann @reconstrvct i wish i was there. next time.
@joerussbowman depends on how fast mongo is. start with one connection per process. try to funnel all the requests though that.
@joeshaw You remember that? haha. What was your irc nickname back then?
@kschzt There is a heap profiler in V8. Unfortunately it's not accessible through the debug agent.
@larzconwell absolutely! golang is a game changer - and must be learned by everyone.
@larzconwell dart is under too much flux to learn now. go has much smaller mem/faster than node but slower to dev with (IMHO)
@larzconwell I love Go! For the reasons other people have mentioned but also: easy data flow control, multi platform dependency-less EXEs
@larzconwell One of my few problems with Go is that it's statically typed - which I think is detrimental for quickly hacking together code.
@matbeeDOTcom node :)
@maxogden gross...
@mikeal Actually, I disagree. I think most professional programmers are above average in multiple languages.
@mikeal just poopin'-ed me. I wasn't really pooping. #FYI
@mikeal nice - that took a while :)
@mikeal why aren't you at the gather release party?
@mkrecny @izs (maybe...)
@mkrecny @izs I think not - opinionated software needs to be written by people with similar same opinions.
@mkrecny @izs re another dim. People have beliefs about systems and languages which are independent each other. Yegge focuses on lang.
@mranney yes :-) no complaints = nobody cares.
@mrdazm https://plus.google.com/u/0/110981030061712822816/posts/KaSKeg4vQtz …
@neonux when a long-term branch is on the verge of being dismissed.
@nycbiker just nerding out learning about all the new protocol work going on
@PatrixCR macbook of course :)

@pgriess great! but are there any servers that speak it?
@pgriess That's a good feature. You using zlib?
@piecioshka about a month, says @izs
@piscisaureus no, i think people should figure it out
@pkrumins I love this series of blog posts!
@polotek @sriramk see http://antirobotrobot.tumblr.com/post/5094268092/wsarecv … for more info
@polotek @sriramk The model is broken. You can't tie up a buffer while doing an overlapped read or else every idle socket costs lots of mem.
@prencher Native win32 node is non-existant. It would be nice, but someone needs to port it.
@RandomEtc yeah. I didn't see the date.
@rbpasker no.. they're not :P
@rekatz https://soundcloud.com/hypercrush/som …
@rektide I like golang a lot but think goroutines sharing memory is a mistake
@rektide the red number in the corner of my gmail was annoying me
@rentzsch I'm interested in your experience of upgrading the app to work with v0.6. Unnecessarily painful?

@ronkorving dart itself has some nascent io libraries
@ronkorving It might be a fun project for someone to tie the two together. Though I think dart's internal io library looks ok
@rudybang i'll do a review lesson for you :)
@ryah it's like saying I know how to use a hammer, a spanner AND a screwdriver. You're supposed to be able to, to do it right.
@ryantenney underscores are the ideal way to indicate private methods / members! Easy convention.
@Stefan_S_from_H should demo the win of split stacks
@stevedekorte @bascule small inflation is a good and intended thing. Forces people to invest in society.
@stevedekorte @bascule yes, let's go for drinks but next week - im away this weekend
@stevedekorte i will be satisfied with the continued inevitable prosperity we will experience in the future, yes. :)
@stevedekorte if youre talking about the US gov there are many large diffs between it and a private company.
@stevedekorte lack of investment in social welfare, public transportation, and edu create that gap. Not 3% inflation.
@stevedekorte loops.
@stevedekorte sorry, i don't understand what you mean
@stevedekorte stability of currency is maybe not a good way to measure success. Dollar is central to economy, mass murderers not so much.
@stevedekorte The alternative? There's a lot of code running now that doesn't require indefinite/deep recursion.
@stevedekorte The us gov is the first thing i trust - before all other institutions. Like most, yes, I trust them to manage inflation.
@stevedekorte unpayable debt = bankrupt. No, i wouldnt trust a bankrupt gov. I do have trust in the US gov (like other non-crackpots ;))
@stevedekorte yet our impossibly complex society continues to improve the lives of its citizens even through wars, natural disasters, etc
@tanepiper that would give a false sense of democracy ;-)
@techmatchmaker ok i like ideas :)
@theophani good idea - that's going to save me a lot of typing :)
@tmm1 holy crap. that's awesome.
@tmm1 i want an invite!
@tmm1, @a2800276 has a http-parser rewrite in java laying around...
@TomNovelli yes. i hate lenovo and will never buy anything from them again.

Can someone create me a x86-64 linux distro in which everything is compiled with -fsplit-stack ? http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SplitStacks …
can someone please give me a dynamic language with split stacks? i don't care if it's multi-threaded
Can someone spec out a generalized form of the GYP file format? JSON w/ conditionals and vars.? Bonus points for a better syntax. ‪#useful‬

hungover :-/
I don't really like C much, but it's the only language which has a reasonable I/O API. This shouldn't be so in the age of messaging.
i find it hilarious that @russellquinn and @amyhoy know each other on twitter. i know them from such different directions :)
i find it very sad that no one has written an irssi clone yet in node.js.
I forget and then meet someone and speak German to them and I'm very surprised to hear myself understand and speak German.
i get my best work done while avoiding making slides!
I guess what i meant to say is: I don't understand why Go isn't a dynamic language - it would be much nicer.
I hear in my mind all of this music and it breaks my heart
i hope soundcloud becomes more like twitter. i think sharing songs is lots of fun.

I would love to write a programming language but it's too damn hard and the win is pretty minimal.
I'm amazed at the speakers for @nodesummit. VP at MSFT, CTO at VMWare, @postwait, @sogrady. #nodejs :O
I'm not sure why I find the term "polyglot" so annoying. Also "embarrassingly parallel" and "dead simple". Like nails on a chalk board.

it's 2012. I'm fucking with the cpu fan control because computer is overheating during long builds. kill me plz
it's bad when gyp scrips reach up into the parent dir for dependencies--breaks modularity. need repository of gyp modules and url linking.
